# MeshNOW - A Sensor Mesh Network over ESP-NOW

Create a mesh network of ESP32 microcontrollers that communicate using ESP-NOW. This constellation allows for long-range communication and is ideal for sparsely covering a larger environment, e.g. outdoors. Another perk of MeshNOW is the transparent forwarding of upper-level protocols. This way you can use any TCP-based application (e.g. MQTT) without manual intervention. Just like connecting to a normal WiFi AP.

This project was created by Marvin Bauer as part of his Bachelor Thesis @ TUM under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Gerndt and guidance of Isaac Núñez at the chair of Computer Architecture and Parallel Systems.
